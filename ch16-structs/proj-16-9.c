// (a)
// struct color make_color(int red, int green, int blue);
// Returns a color structure containing the specified red, 
// green, and blue values. If any argument is less than zero, 
// the corresponding member of the structure will contain zero 
// instead. If any argument is greater than 255, the corresponding 
// member of the structure will contain 255.

// (b)
// int getRed(struct color c);
// Returns the value of c's red member.

// (c)
// bool equal_color(struct color color1, struct color color2);
// Returns true if the corresponding members of color1 and color2 are equal.

// (d)
// struct color brighter(struct color c);
// Returns a color structure that represents a brighter version of the color c. 
// The structure is identical to c, except that each member has been divided by 
// 0.7 (with the result truncated to an integer). However, there are three special cases:
// (1) If all members of c are zero, the function returns a color whose members all have the value 3.
// (2) If any member of c is greater than 0 but less than 3, it is replaced by 3 before the division by 0.7.
// (3) If dividing by 0.7 causes a member to exceed 255, it is reduced to 255.

// (e)
// struct color darker(struct color c);
// Returns a color structure that represents a darker version of the color c. 
// The structure is identical to c, except that each member has been multiplied 
// by 0.7 (with the result truncated to an integer).
